## About Helping Hands

Helping Hands is a Non-Profit organization that attempts to harness the potential of motivated individuals to work together and solve problems in the community. Volunteers can sign up to view different volunteering events coming up in their area, and also sign up to attend those events. Registered volunteers are given a profile and can manage their events from the webpage.

In addition, Helping Hands has an onsite community kitchen which serves food daily to the community free of charge. Guests are able to see the list of upcoming meals and sign up for a spot at that meal. Non-profit staff is also able to see the list of meal reservations to anticipate a mealâ€™s attendance.
