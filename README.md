## About Helping Hands

Helping Hands is a Non-Profit organization that attempts to harness the potential of motivated individuals to work together and solve problems in the community. Volunteers can sign up to view different volunteering events coming up in their area, and also sign up to attend those events. Registered volunteers are given a profile and can manage their events from the webpage.

In addition, Helping Hands has an onsite community kitchen which serves food daily to the community free of charge. Guests are able to see the list of upcoming meals and sign up for a spot at that meal. Non-profit staff is also able to see the list of meal reservations to anticipate a mealâ€™s attendance.

## How to Run Helping Hands on your Local Device

1. In your terminal and in your desired directory type the follow command:

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/git-jala/helping-hands.git
```

2. cd into the project directory

```
cd helping-hands
```

3. Make sure you have Docker installed then in your terminal type the following commands:

```
docker volume create hands-data
```

- This will create the Docker database.

```
docker compose build
```

- This will create the Docker containers and images.

```
docker compose up
```

- This will run the Docker containers

4. When the Docker containers are running make sure to check the api container because on inital setup it will sometimes turn off all you need to do is click the start button to get going again and it will work from then on.

5. When the Docker containers are running you can open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) to view all of the RESTful backend endpoints.

6. When the Docker containers are running you can open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
   - This will take you to the project home page and you can navigate via the navbar dropdown menu.
