## Journals

Please keep all of your individual journals in this directory.

Each team member is required to keep a development journal, which should be a single markdown file with an entry for each day the project was worked on.

Recommended naming convention is `first_last.md`.

## 9/27

worked on tables and mirgrations
finished auth and create user

## 9/28

created the update event endpoint
group: finished CRUD for event

## 10/9-10/13

Worked on create user_events
group: pushed protected endpoints to main branch
worked on user_events endpoints
was annoyed trying to get user_events to filter by each user on the backend,
and the orignal solution worked
Got User events endpoints merged had Jack look at it and approve it for me
started working on a barebones login page
finished working on my barebones login page was just pure html and no styling but the functionality is all there
Had Jack look at my merge request for login page and was able to approve it
Started on making a basic signup page similar to what I did with login
I was able to finish it same day I started it and have Jack again go and approve the MR

## 10/16-10/20
Started the week off with adding MUI into the project so we could add styling to some of the pages we made and to make sure it doesn't cause any issues and after installing it I had a teammate look at and approve the MR to add it in.
I then went and added styling to Login Form, Signup Form and also List events page throughout the week and all those have been approved and merged
After adding the styling to those existing pages I went and started working on the main page just was having some serious issues were the components to each portion of the page would break the whole page so it was a lot of trial and error but I eventually got a bare bones thing done

## 10/23-10/27
I went and added more styling to the main page and added our gitlabs into the mainpage so people can access each of our accounts
I went and added a few unit tests to the users table was able to make one for everything except create a user and get a single user
I then added styling to our create event form thats on the admin page
We have an issue with our front end deployment and needed to fix our links from pointing to localhost to public url instead
Also updated my journal because I forgot that was a portion of the project that needed to be done
